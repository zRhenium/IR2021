President Xi Jinping on Thursday spoke highly of China's achievements in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the volatile international situation, saying the great and courageous Chinese people will continue to create miracles. 
Xi, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remark while addressing a New Year's gathering held by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing. 
Looking back at 2020, Xi said that the achievements China produced are outstanding despite a great many hardships. The achievements are the result of the strong leadership of the CPC and the united and tenacious struggle of the Chinese people, fully demonstrating the Chinese spirit and power, he added. 
Xi said that amid the complex domestic and international situations, the country had strategic achievements in fighting the pandemic, overcame severe flooding disasters, achieved positive economic growth, met the poverty-reduction target and made great headway in major scientific and technological projects. 
Historic achievements have been reached in completing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has made great strides, he added. 
Speaking of the country's unswerving efforts to push for reform and opening-up, Xi said that all the tasks and goals that were set at the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the CPC in November 2013 have been fulfilled, and 2,485 reform plans have been carried out. 
While stressing adherence to the principle of "one country, two systems" to promote economic development and social stability of the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions, Xi said the country resolutely upholds peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits in line with the one-China policy and the 1992 Consensus. 
In the face of rising unilateralism, protectionism and hegemony, China made positive contributions to the global fight against the pandemic in solidarity with the international community and while promoting peace and development, Xi said.
