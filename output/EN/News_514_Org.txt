TAIYUAN -- China's top legislator has called for implementing Xi Jinping Thought on the Rule of Law in the work of people's congresses and making contributions to building a modern socialist country. 
Li Zhanshu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), made the remarks during an inspection tour in North China's Shanxi province from Monday to Wednesday. 
Li said the most significant outcome of the central conference on work related to overall law-based governance was the establishment of Xi Jinping Thought on the Rule of Law, which serves as the fundamental guideline for overall law-based governance in China. 
Stressing giving full play to the role of the NPC and local-level people's congresses in implementing overall law-based governance, Li called for pooling wisdom and strength from all aspects to serve social and economic development during the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) period. 
Li also acknowledged the progress that Shanxi has made in reform and innovation, strengthening ecological conservation, as well as promoting high-quality development.Top legislator stresses implementing Xi Jinping Thought on the Rule of LawLi Zhanshu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), visits a community-level center for NPC deputies during an inspection tour in Taiyuan, North China's Shanxi province, on Nov 17, 2020.
