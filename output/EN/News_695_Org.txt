Premier Li Keqiang urged the officials newly appointed by the State Council to make every effort to benefit the people and ease their worries during the process of policymaking and pushing forward reform in a ceremony on Tuesday. 
Li's remarks came as he oversaw 31 high-ranking officials take an oath to the Constitution in Beijing in the Cabinet's sixth such ceremony in which senior officials pledge their allegiance to China's fundamental law. 
The officials, from 28 central government departments and institutions, were appointed to their positions by the Cabinet from December to September. 
The premier called upon the officials to keep firmly in their minds the oath they have sworn and translate their words into action, saying that they must assume their duties in accordance with the law and try their best to serve the people. 
He underlined the importance for them to stay enterprising, take their responsibilities, tackle difficulties and conduct their work in a solid manner. 
Development remained the key to solving all problems, and the officials must work towards new accomplishments in a bold, diligent and smart manner, the premier said. 
He called for the officials to adhere to clean governance, obey laws and regulations, guard against abuse of power and serve the public interest wholeheartedly. 
Placing his left hand on a red-covered copy of the Constitution and holding his right hand upward, Zhang Gong, head of the State Administration for Market Regulation, led the officials in the oath-taking. 
In 2015, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's top legislature, passed and released a legal document that requires all public servants take the oath and abide by the Constitution.High-ranking officials take oath to ConstitutionPremier Li Keqiang oversees 31 high-ranking officials take an oath to the Constitution in Beijing in a ceremony held by State Council in Beijing on Sept 29, 2020.
