Court tries confiscation of red notice fugitive's illegal gainsHOHHOT -- A court in Hohhot, North China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region, opened a trial Wednesday concerning the confiscation of the illegal gains of a red notice fugitive, who is on the list of China's most wanted graft suspects.
The prosecutors applied to confiscate nine housing estates of Bai Jing, an embezzlement suspect at large, stating that Bai was suspected of taking advantage of his post as an official of the Agricultural Bank of China to embezzle funds and later used part of the illegal gains to buy multiple estates under the names of his wife and relatives.
Bai fled overseas in 2013 and failed to turn himself in after the warrant for his arrest was issued.
One of the interested parties involved, who is a nominal holder of four of the properties, attended the trial and stated no objection to the confiscation. Other interested parties waived their rights in the case.
After the trial, the court said the sentence will be announced at a later date.Court tries confiscation of red notice fugitive's illegal gainsHOHHOT -- A court in Hohhot, North China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region, opened a trial Wednesday concerning the confiscation of the illegal gains of a red notice fugitive, who is on the list of China's most wanted graft suspects.
