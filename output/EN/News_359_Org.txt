BEIJING -- Chinese lawmakers on Wednesday started deliberating a draft law on wetlands protection, the country's first national legislation on conserving its lakes and swamps. 
The draft was submitted to an ongoing session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's top legislature, for the first reading. 
In strengthening the management of wetlands, the draft stipulates that a national catalog of important wetlands shall be compiled by forestry and grassland authorities and other related departments of the State Council, while provincial-level governments shall compile catalogs of important wetlands within their jurisdiction. 
The draft prohibits any organization or individual from destroying the habitat of birds and aquatic life in wetlands. 
Those breaching the law may be fined up to 1 million yuan (about $154,523) or face criminal penalties if their violations constitute crimes, according to the draft.Chinese lawmakers debate wetlands protection lawGroups of black-headed gulls spend winter in Yilong National Wetland Park in Shiping county, Yunnan province.
