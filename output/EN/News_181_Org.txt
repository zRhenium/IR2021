Premier Li Keqiang stressed the need to keep consolidating the economic recovery from the downturn caused by COVID-19 and seeking high-quality growth. 
Speaking with legislators from Jiangsu province in their panel discussion, he said the province should further enhance its role as an economic powerhouse, deepen reform and opening-up and strengthen new growth engines.

Li Zhanshu, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, underlined the necessity of attaining high-quality growth as he joined the discussion with legislators from Gansu province. 
The province should carry forward the new development philosophy, foster a new development paradigm and work toward new progress in raising the income of residents and enabling prosperity in rural areas, he said. 
Wang Yang, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, took part in a panel discussion with NPC deputies from Taiwan province.

Wang Huning, a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, called for new steps in promoting high-quality growth while taking part in a panel discussion with NPC deputies from Yunnan province. 
He called for measures to boost the leadership of the Party and Party building across the board, with meticulous steps to carry out study sessions on the Party's history. 
Zhao Leji, secretary of the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, China's top anti-graft body, called for faithful implementation of the new development philosophy and pursuing a new path of high-quality growth as he spoke with legislators from the Ningxia Hui autonomous region.
