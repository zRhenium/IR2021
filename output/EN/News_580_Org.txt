China will launch major research projects in artificial intelligence, quantum information technology, integrated circuits, life science and health, brain science, aerospace technology, and deep earth and ocean explorations, as well as other cutting-edge fields, according to a key document published on Tuesday. 
The document was released by the Communist Party of China Central Committee about the Party leadership's proposals for formulating the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) for national economic and social development and long-range objectives through the year 2035. It was adopted at the fifth plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, which closed on Thursday. 
The document said China will need to strengthen its capability in strategic science and technology fields, and overcome challenges in key and core technologies. 
The nation also will enhance basic and interdisciplinary research, launch new science initiatives and projects, and encourage sharing and better allocation of resources between research institutions, universities and companies. 
China will reorganize its state key laboratories, create new comprehensive national science centers and regional highland of innovation, and support Beijing, Shanghai and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area becoming a global science and technology innovation center, the document said.Major cutting-edge science research projects preparing to launchA boy experiences a VR device at the 2019 China International Consumer Electronics Show in Qingdao, East China's Shandong province, July 19, 2019.
