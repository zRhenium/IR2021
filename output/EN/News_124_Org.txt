BEIJING -- China's State Council Information Office on Wednesday issued the Report on Human Rights Violations in the United States in 2020. 
The report said Washington's incompetent pandemic containment led to tragic outcomes and that American democracy disorder triggered political chaos. 
Ethnic minorities suffered racial discrimination and continuous social unrest threatened public security in the United States, it said. 
The report also drew attention to the growing polarization between the rich and the poor that aggravated social inequality in America. 
The US trampling on international rules resulted in humanitarian disasters, it added. 
People of color faced an even greater threat of unemployment, the report said. Figures released by the US Department of Labor in September showed the jobless rate for the black people almost doubled that for the white. 
Inequality between races worsened in the United States, said the report, citing statistics that showed the median white household has 41 times more wealth than the median black family and 22 times more than the median Latino family.
