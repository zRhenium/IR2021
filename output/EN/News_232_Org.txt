China and the US were the two leading users that saw marked growth in patent filings in 2020, the report said.
China filed 68,720 applications, up 16.1 percent year-on-year, and remained the largest user of the WIPO's Patent Cooperation Treaty, a system that assists applicants in seeking patent protection internationally.
The US followed with 59,230 applications, up 3 percent year-on-year. Other major users include Japan, with 50,520 applications, down by 4.1 percent, and Germany with 18,643 applications, down 3.7 percent.

China-based telecom giant Huawei Technologies was the top filer of applications for a fourth consecutive year in 2020.
