BEIJING -- Chinese lawmakers are considering a new draft law that would allow restaurants to charge diners an extra fee if they waste excessive amounts of food. 
The draft anti-food-waste law was on Monday returned to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) for a second reading. 
According to the draft, catering service providers could charge customers who leave excessive amounts of food waste a disposal fee, but rates for the charge must be clearly advertised. 
Approximately 18 billion kilograms of food is wasted every year in China's urban catering industry, according to a report based on nationwide field research carried out by NPC deputies.China deliberates extra fees for food wastersA student uploads a photo of his empty plate to a WeChat mini program called Clear Plate at the canteen of his school.
