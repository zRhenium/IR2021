A provision to further ensure the rights of servicewomen has been added to a draft law on the protection and status of military personnel submitted to the Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress on Monday. 
The draft law stipulates that the military should arrange reasonable work assignments, rest and annual leave for servicewomen and provide special protection on maternity and health issues. 
The amendments for second review also include an additional chapter on the status of military personnel to further highlight their special status and duties, preferential policies for military families and clarifications on the duties of townships and other local authorities. 
One provision defined military honors as commendations and incentives from the State and society to recognize military personnel's dedication to national defense, building up the military and socialist modernization. Honors also serve to boost morale and enhance combat effectiveness. 
The second deliberation on the draft law is part of the agenda of the 28th session of the NPC Standing Committee, China's top legislature, which runs from Monday to Thursday. 
The draft law on the status and protection of military personnel's rights was first reviewed in December. 
Zang Tiewei, a spokesman for the NPC Standing Committee's Legislative Affairs Commission, said at a news briefing last week the NPC received 5,602 comments from 2,783 people on its website as well as 74 letters after the first review. 
He said opinions mainly focused on highlighting the status of military personnel, strengthening the protection of military honors, improving payments and other preferential treatment. The employment of military personnel's spouses and the schooling of their children were issues also raised. 
"The second draft review has incorporated some of these suggestions," he said.Strengthening servicewomen's rights included in draft lawWomen soldiers introduce themselves at Jinan military area command, in Jinan, capital of East China's Shandong province. [Photo/CFP]
