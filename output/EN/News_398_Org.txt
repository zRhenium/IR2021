A key Party meeting presided over by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, on Thursday called for stronger political awareness in pushing for work in all areas and aspects to realize the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. 
During the daylong meeting, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee heard a series of work reports from leading Party members groups of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the State Council, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, as well as from the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee. Xi delivered a speech at the meeting. 
The meeting's participants reaffirmed the importance of upholding the authority of the CPC Central Committee and its centralized and unified leadership, and called it a top principle of upholding the Party's leadership and also key to leveraging the country's institutional advantages, according to a statement released after the meeting. 
The CPC Central Committee's hearing of reports from leading Party members' groups of the five State bodies and the Secretariat each year is an important institutional arrangement to uphold the committee's authority and its centralized and unified leadership, the statement said. 
The meeting's participants commended the five State bodies' work in the past year and acknowledged their contributions in coordinating epidemic prevention and control with social and economic development, the statement said, adding that new and greater progress has been made in all aspects of their work. 
The Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee was also commended for ensuring the implementation of the decisions and plans of the CPC Central Committee, as well as for improving Party regulations and guiding the work and reform of various organizations. 
Noting that this year marks the centenary of the Party's founding as well as the first year of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25), the meeting's participants urged the State bodies to be fully confident of the nations' development while remaining vigilant about the risks and challenges on the way ahead.Key meeting emphasizes strong political awarenessPresident Xi Jinping.
