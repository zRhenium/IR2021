LHASA -- The legislature of Southwest China's Tibet autonomous region has expressed its strong indignation and firm opposition to the passing of a United States act on Tibet. 
The so-called "Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2020" grossly interferes in China's internal affairs and gravely violates the fundamental principles of international laws and basic norms governing international relations, according to a statement by the Standing Committee of the People's Congress of Tibet autonomous region on Wednesday. 
The US act maliciously distorts Tibet's social development, makes groundless accusations, denigrates China's ethnic and religious policies, and interferes in the normal reincarnation procedure of living Buddhas under the pretext of human rights and religion, the statement said. 
"The real purpose of the act is to undermine Tibet's prosperity and stability," said the statement.Tibet legislature decries US act smearing developmentElderly people play games at a nursing center in Nagarze county of Shannan city, Southwest China's Tibet autonomous region, July 30, 2020.
