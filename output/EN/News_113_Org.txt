Premier Li Keqiang underlined the importance of bolstering the nation's capacity for innovation and harnessing its growth engines while continuously improving people's livelihoods, during an inspection trip to Jiangsu province on Thursday and Friday. 
Li visited Changzhou and the provincial capital, Nanjing, where he spoke with business leaders, community residents, university students and researchers. 
The premier inspected Hengli Hydraulic Co, a Changzhou-based hydraulics manufacturer, where he inquired about the company's products, its technologies and input into research and development. 
He encouraged the company to stay innovative while remaining open and eager for cooperation. 
Executives from over 10 manufacturers shared their thoughts with Li about the tax incentives offered by the State Council for companies to boost their research and development. The premier said the policy is intended to serve as a boon for businesses to boost their inputs into innovation. 
Only with innovation can businesses win in future competition and the nation attain better growth, he said. 
Li spoke with residents from a community in Changzhou, where he stressed the importance of ensuring that elderly groups receive good care, a move that will also give the youth a desirable future. 
At the China (Jiangsu) Pilot Free Trade Zone, he encouraged local officials to continue to move forward with institutional innovation and bring together cutting-edge production elements to assist the FTZ in leading reform and opening-up. 
Li visited Nanjing University and learned about its fundamental research and the transformation of research outcomes. He encouraged researchers to collaborate across different scientific disciplines and work toward integrated innovation. 
The premier spoke with academicians from the university and expressed his hope that innovation can be pursued from generation to generation to make development more sustainable. 
He encouraged students to live up to the motto of the university－sincerity with aspiration, perseverance with integrity－and stay focused on their studies while keeping their feet firmly on the ground to realize their ambitions.Li stresses innovation in Jiangsu inspection tripPremier Li Keqiang inspected Hengli Hydraulic Co, a Changzhou-based hydraulics manufacturer during an inspection trip to Jiangsu province on Thursday and Friday.
