BEIJING -- Vice-Premier Sun Chunlan on Sunday called for strengthened efforts in epidemic prevention and control for the upcoming Spring Festival, or the Chinese Lunar New Year. 
Containment measures against COVID-19 should be fully implemented and responsibilities should be assigned to ensure a safe and happy holiday, Sun stressed during a symposium convened at the National Health Commission. 
Noting that medical and health workers have been fighting on the front line against the epidemic for more than a year, Sun called for persistent efforts in epidemic control, as well as further improved measures and contingency plans.
