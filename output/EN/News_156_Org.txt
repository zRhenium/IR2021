Su Gang, the owner of a shop selling hot food in Yantai, Shandong province, was delighted when he heard Premier Li Keqiang mention the shop on Thursday during a news conference following the close of the annual session of the 13th National People's Congress. 
Answering questions about the pandemic's effect on employment, Li shared a story about his inspection of an old residential community in Yantai's Zhifu district in June. He had spoken with merchants operating booths and small shops about the impact of the coronavirus on their businesses. 
"Li asked me how badly my business had been affected, whether I had received policy backing and whether staff members were paid on time," Su told China Youth Daily. 
"I was going through the toughest time since I started my business more than 10 years ago. My shop was closed for three months because of COVID-19. We had to package our products and sell them at stalls in the community and through online platforms." 
Su paid the 20 workers at his shop a basic salary to support their lives. 
"I was moved that all the employees chose to stay with me through the most difficult time instead of leaving," he said. "The policies that backed businesses — including reduced rent and taxes and lower costs for water and electricity — were timely." 
He added that he was able to cut spending by at least 300,000 yuan ($46,290) last year. 
Now the shop has returned to normal, and the salaries of employees have been raised by 10 percent. 
Su opened two shops at the end of last year, creating jobs for 20 more people. He also set up a special team to do livestreaming to promote his products. 
"I want to tell our premier that we are now confident in our future, and we will work harder to contribute our part to the country," Su said.Shop owner gets a nod from Chinese premierPremier Li Keqiang visits a community in Yantai, Shandong province on June 1, 2020 to talk to merchants and vendors operating booths and small shops about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their businesses, whether they are receiving policy backing and are paying their staff on time.
