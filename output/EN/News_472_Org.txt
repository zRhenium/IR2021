China to sanction US officials for meddlingChina will sanction United States officials who meddle in the affairs of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, as a countermeasure to US sanctions against senior Chinese lawmakers, according to a statement from China's top legislature on Wednesday.
The statement was made by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress after the US announced sanctions on 14 vice-chairpersons of the committee, citing its decision to enact the National Security Law for Hong Kong and another decision that led to the disqualification of four Hong Kong opposition lawmakers.
"The US sanctions are a typical example of political bullying and double standards. We strongly condemn and oppose this," the statement said.
Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs. The NPC Standing Committee adopted the National Security Law for Hong Kong to safeguard China's national sovereignty, security and development interests and Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability, as well as to ensure the stable and long-term operation of the principle of "one country, two systems", the statement said.
"We firmly oppose any external interference in Hong Kong affairs in any way and will fulfill our lawful duties as always to handle Hong Kong affairs in accordance with the law," the statement said.
The Chinese government is firmly committed to safeguarding China's national sovereignty, security and development interests, implementing "one country, two systems" fully and faithfully, and opposing any interference in Hong Kong affairs.
