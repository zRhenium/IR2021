The amended law, with a new chapter on internet protection, was passed at the closing ceremony of the bimonthly session of National People's Congress, the country's top legislative body, and it will become effective on June 1, 2021. 
In the new chapter, the law clarifies responsibilities of internet service providers, demanding they take measures to prevent children from experiencing online bullying and being indulged in cyberspace.

Also, hotels are ordered to ask for the contacts of minors' parents or guardians when helping children check in or the children attempt to have the check-in with adults, it said, adding hotels should call police if something is suspicious or staff suspect violations. 
Before the law was reviewed and passed, it was deliberated by the NPC Standing Committee in October 2019 and June this year.
