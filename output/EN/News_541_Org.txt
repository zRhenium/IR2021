NPC passes tougher Copyright Law[Photo/Sipa] 
  
 
China's top legislature adopted on Wednesday an amended Copyright Law which provides stronger protection for copyright, especially for those in cyberspace, and gives tougher punishments to copycats. 
The law increases compensation paid by violators when the losses of copyright owners, the benefit gained by the copycats or copyright license fees cannot be determined, as a bigger threat to fight piracy and a stronger tool to protect creativity. 
The revised law, after being reviewed by the top legislature three times, was adopted by the Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress when it closed its 23rd session on Wednesday in Beijing. 
Before the adoption, the country also strengthened intellectual property rights protection by revising and passing the Patent Law and Trademark Law.NPC passes tougher Copyright Law[Photo/Sipa]
