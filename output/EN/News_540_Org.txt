Political advisers should make suggestions and build consensus in society for the country's formulation and implementation of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25), said Wang Yang, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, China's top political advisory body. 
Wang, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, made the remark at the closing of a three-day meeting of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee in Beijing. 
The meeting was themed on studying the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which adopted the Party leadership's proposals for formulating the 14th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035. 
Wang called on making full use of the political advisory body's talent pool to deepen research on major theoretical and practical issues for mapping-out the plan. 
He said political advisers should study and grasp the essence of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way and focus on important features of Chinese-style modernization, including the large size of the population, common prosperity, harmony between material and spiritual civilization, harmony between humans and nature, and the path of peaceful development.CPPCC members' suggestions needed for preparing 14th Five-Year PlanA three-day meeting of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee is held in Beijing Nov 10, 2020.
