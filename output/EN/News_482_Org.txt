BEIJING -- China's top legislator on Friday called for the implementation of Xi Jinping Thought on the Rule of Law and the advancement of law-based governance and Constitution-based governance. 
Li Zhanshu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), made the remarks at a seminar marking the seventh Constitution Day. 
Li urged greater efforts to study and implement Xi Jinping Thought on the Rule of Law, which contains important ideas about the role of the Constitution, and to summarize experiences to promote the full implementation of the Constitution, providing a strong constitutional guarantee for fully building a modern socialist China. 
Xi's key discourses on the Constitution have become a fully built and scientific system of constitutional theories, Li said, expounding the system's essentials that highlighted upholding Party leadership as the fundamental political principle of the Constitution, the Constitution's supreme status in the country's legal system, and the idea that all the state's power belongs to the people. 
The system of constitutional theories also specified the distinct advantage of China's Constitution and its role in China's state and governance systems, as well as the supervision mechanism and supportive measures for its implementation, according to Li. 
He stressed the importance of efforts to safeguard the authority of the Constitution, promote its comprehensive and effective implementation, uphold the unity of the country's legal system, raise public awareness of the Constitution system and its practice so as to advance law-based governance and Constitution-based governance to higher levels.Top legislator stresses importance of advancing Constitution-based governanceLi Zhanshu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, attends a seminar on the implementation of Xi Jinping Thought on the Rule of Law and the advancement of law-based governance and Constitution-based governance in Beijing, capital of China, Dec 4, 2020, the seventh Constitution Day.
