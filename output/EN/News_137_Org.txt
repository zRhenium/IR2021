Premier Li Keqiang has highlighted the need to balance the growth of the economy, residential income and the job market, saying China will not pursue the growth of its GDP at the cost of high energy consumption and high pollution. 
In a video conference with foreign representatives to the China Development Forum 2021 in Beijing on Monday, Li said China will give priority to growth with higher quality and efficiency while maintaining the stable fundamentals of is economy. 
In doing so, the country must attain relatively full employment, the sustained growth of residential income, a continuously improving ecology and environment, the further refining of its economic structure and steady improvement in labor productivity, he said. 
Li also explained the government's decision to set the target of this year's economic growth at above 6 percent, saying the goal took into account the ongoing economic recovery and the need to consolidate the foundation of growth. 
The target will also be better aligned with goals to be set next year and the year after next, he added. 
While a growth target of at least 6 percent is not low, the actual economic growth this year could be higher, he said, adding the government is trying to better guide market expectations. 
The premier also stressed the need to improve the vitality and performance of market entities, keep moving forward with the urbanization process, unleash the immense potential of consumer spending and harness the role of consumption in spurring economic growth.Li stresses balance in future growthChinese Premier Li Keqiang attends a video conference with foreign representatives to the China Development Forum 2021 in Beijing on Monday.[Photo/Xinhua]
