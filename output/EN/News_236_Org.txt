Ministry of National Defense says China will not pursue hegemony or expansion 
The Chinese military will adamantly protect the nation's sovereignty and security, safeguard equality and justice, and be a staunch ally in maintaining world peace, the Ministry of National Defense said in a statement on Monday. 
A guideline on international military cooperation, signed by President Xi Jinping, who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission, came into effect on Monday. 
With 48 articles in eight chapters, the guideline provides a detailed and comprehensive framework for carrying out major tasks related to international military cooperation, such as event planning and risk management. It is also the "first regulation of its kind for the Chinese military in the new era, meaning its global military cooperation has reached new heights in terms of regulating and standardizing practices", the ministry said. 
In recent years, some people have claimed that China is changing its defensive national defense policy as the country builds up its military and adopts a tougher stance when handling issues with neighboring countries. 
In response, the ministry said that given China's peace-loving culture and strategic decision to follow a peaceful path of development, China will adamantly uphold a defense policy that is defensive in nature. 
"Never pursuing hegemony, expansion or spheres of influence are the characteristics of the Chinese military," the ministry said. "Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have never instigated a war, nor have we ever invaded or occupied an inch of foreign land. 
"We will not lose an inch of our land left to us by our ancestors, and we will not covet anything from others. China's defense and military development are solely for meeting the needs of protecting national sovereignty, security and development interests. It does not target or threaten any country." 
When commenting on China-US military relations, the ministry said bilateral ties are currently at a crossroad. "Harmony brings mutual benefits, confrontation brings mutual harm, cooperation is the only right choice for both sides," it said. 
China-US military-to-military relations are a key part of bilateral relations, and maintaining healthy and stable military relations is also in the interests of both parties, the ministry said. 
"We hope the US side can work with China to fulfill the consensus reached by the two state leaders, and uphold the principles of nonconfrontation, mutual respect, cooperation and win-win," it said. 
The ministry also said it hoped both sides can enhance dialogue, expand pragmatic cooperation, properly handle differences and facilitate China-US military-to-military relations going forward. 
When commenting on some US officials hyping the so-called Chinese threat and urging allies to jointly compete against China, the ministry said the world has entered a new era where peace, development, cooperation and win-win are the norm. 
"Military alliance against a third party is a product of Cold-War mentality," it said. "It is no longer appropriate for the current age and should be tossed into the trash bin of history. 
"We support the concept of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and are against winner-take-all, zero-sum-game mentalities. We support building new international relations based on mutual respect, fairness and justice, cooperation and win-win, and oppose a military alliance that is exclusive and confrontational in nature." 
The ministry said the China-Russia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership of Coordination in the New Era is an example of the new form of international relations. 
"Both sides uphold the principles of non-alliance, non-confrontation and not targeting a third country," it said. "This is fundamentally different from the military alliance between some countries. 
"China-Russia military relations have operated in high gear, and this is a key symbol for the uniqueness and quality of the bilateral ties," the ministry said, adding this year marks the 20th anniversary of the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation between China and Russia. 
"China is willing to work with the Russian side to deepen cooperation in high-level exchanges, strategic collaboration, joint exercises, military equipment and technology, and other fields to comprehensively develop China-Russia military relations," it said. "This will provide positive energy in maintaining the common interests of both nations, as well as peace and stability around the world."Guideline sets out framework to advance military cooperationPhoto taken on Feb 24, 2021 shows naval forces of China and Singapore conducting a joint drill in waters near Singapore.
