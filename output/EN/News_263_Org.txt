China will conduct strict low-carbon management during the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games and strive to attain carbon neutrality at the event, Vice-Premier Han Zheng said on Tuesday. 
In remarks made at a leading group that oversees the Beijing 2022 preparations, Han, who is the head of the group, urged a stronger sense of responsibility, mission and urgency as preparatory work for the Games "entered a crucial stage". 
It is important to ensure that the Games is hosted in a simple, safe and wonderful manner, overcome various risks and challenges and ensure the events will be held as scheduled, he said. 
The meeting came after President Xi Jinping inspected the venues of the Games and hosted a meeting last month on the preparations for the Games, in which he called for coordinated efforts in containing the COVID-19 pandemic and preparing for the events. 
Han urged meticulous efforts in the construction management of the venues, with continuous steps to improve the competition grounds and facilities and ensure all noncompetition venues and supporting facilities can be delivered on schedule.

The testing events must be organized in a flexible manner on the premise of sound epidemic containment measures, he said. 
Han highlighted the need to establish an operation command system during the Games to foster command, dispatch and emergency response capacities that guarantee a smooth decision-making, dispatching and operation process. 
He urged sound measures to ensure the success of the opening and closing ceremonies and the torch relay, saying that accommodation, catering, transport and security services must be well prepared. 
Athletes should beef up their preparations and the government must continuously popularize winter sports among the public, he said. 
Han vowed zero-tolerance on doping, underlining the need to implement the requirements of clean Olympic Games.Strict green management vital during 2022 GamesVice Premier Han Zheng, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, presides over a meeting of the leading group which oversees the Beijing 2022 preparations in Beijing, Feb 23, 2021.
