The United States, Canada and the United Kingdom joined the European Union on Monday to take what they described as "coordinated action" against China, which contains travel bans and asset freezes on former and current senior Chinese officials from the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. 
Following are their responses to the sanctions: 
Wang Junzheng 
Political commissar of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps 
The sanctions imposed to individuals and entities in Xinjiang in the name of human rights issues are based on lies and false information. The move is a gross slander and an affront to the reputation and dignity of the Chinese people. 
It is an interference with China's internal affairs, and a serious violation of China's sovereignty and security interests. It has severely trampled on international laws and the basic norms of international relations. That's why I strongly oppose and condemn it. 
I want to state that I have no interest in traveling to the EU, US, UK or Canada. Also, I don't have a penny saved in their banks. So the sanction is nothing but a piece of waste paper and a self-inflicted humiliation. I am sure that the majority of the international community will despise the decision. 
It seems that the EU, US, UK and Canada have found treasures after learning about the fabricated "evidence" from anti-China politicians and so-called scholars. They then have tried their best to play the tricks of sticking labels on Xinjiang and slandering the region, which have fully exposed their intentions of sabotaging Xinjiang's development and stability and interfering with China's internal affairs. 
I urge those countries to stop the ridiculous farce. They should never underestimate Chinese people's strong will to safeguard national interests and dignity.Chinese officials respond to Xinjiang-related sanctionsChildren have fun on Dove Lane in Hotan city, Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, May 27, 2020.
