There is no end to China's development, reform and opening-up, Vice-President Wang Qishan said during a discussion with representatives of Chinese and foreign entrepreneurs. 
It is a long-term historical process for China stepping onto a new stage, implementing new ideas, building a new pattern and realizing the modernization of the Chinese nation, Wang said at the Tuesday gathering during the annual conference of the Boao Forum for Asia in Boao, Hainan province. 
The Communist Party of China takes it as its goal to satisfy the people's yearning for a better life, Wang said. 
The development and changes of the Boao Forum for Asia over the past 20 years and the continuous growth of foreign-funded enterprises in China illustrate the continuous improvement of the socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics, he said. 
Glory goes with suffering, and it is important to keep calm and build confidence and patience through thinking in historical, cultural and philosophical dimensions, he said. 
The vice-president voiced his hope that all walks of life can deeply understand the essence of President Xi Jinping's keynote speech delivered to the forum, adhere to their ideals, keep their feet on the ground and keep moving forward. 
The entrepreneurs present at the gathering told Wang that the solution offered by China and the super resilience of the Chinese economy are exciting, and they will seize the opportunity, deeply integrate with China's new development pattern and commit themselves to jointly building the Belt and Road. 
At the conference's opening ceremony on Tuesday, Wang expressed warm congratulations on the 20th anniversary of the forum. 
Wang noted that President Xi elaborated in his speech to the forum via video link on China's position and shared China's plan to promote the development and prosperity of Asia and the world, and that Xi expressed the Chinese government's consistent support for the development and growth of the forum. 
In a separate meeting with members of the forum's board of directors and the forum's strategic partners, Wang pointed out that over the past 20 years, the forum has grown into a high-level platform for political and business circles to strengthen dialogue and seek cooperation, and has played an important role in Asia's development and exchanges between Asia and the world. 
Also, it is more necessary than ever for all parties to strengthen exchanges, build consensus and cooperate, which creates broad space for the development of the forum.Vice-President: China's reform, opening-up to continueChinese Vice-President Wang Qishan attends the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) Annual Conference 2021 opening ceremony in Boao, South China's Hainan province, April 20, 2021.
