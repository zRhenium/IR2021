Former Inner Mongolia senior political advisor expelled from CPC, public officeBEIJING -- Ma Ming, former vice chairman of the Inner Mongolia regional committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, has been expelled from the Communist Party of China (CPC) and dismissed from public office over serious violations of Party discipline and laws, the country's top anti-graft body announced Monday.
The CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission said in a statement that an investigation found that Ma abandoned his original aspiration and mission, as well as breached the bottom line of discipline and law.
Probe found that Ma flouted the Party's eight-point rules by receiving a huge sum of gifts and money, as well as attending banquets and accepting arrangement for accommodation that could influence fairness in official duties. In addition, he failed to report personal information in keeping with rules.
The investigation also found that Ma had violated regulations on the selection and appointment of officials and undermined the local political ecology.
He took advantage of his posts to seek benefits for others in terms of case handling and business operations, illegally accepting a large amount of property and money in return, according to the statement.
Ma violated organizational discipline of the Party, discipline on upholding integrity and work discipline, and is suspected of taking bribes, said the statement, noting that he showed no sign of restraint even after the 18th CPC National Congress.
His illicit gains will be confiscated and the suspected crimes will be transferred to the procuratorate for further investigation and prosecution, the statement said.Former Inner Mongolia senior political advisor expelled from CPC, public officeBEIJING -- Ma Ming, former vice chairman of the Inner Mongolia regional committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, has been expelled from the Communist Party of China (CPC) and dismissed from public office over serious violations of Party discipline and laws, the country's top anti-graft body announced Monday.
