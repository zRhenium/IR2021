BEIJING - China has set a sound growth target for 2021, leaving room for policymakers to carry out arduous reforms to tackle bottlenecks constraining sustainable development. 
"A target of over 6 percent (of economic growth) will enable all of us to devote full energy to promoting reform, innovation, and high-quality development," Premier Li Keqiang said in the government work report delivered to the national legislature, which began its annual session Friday. 
The report, along with the draft blueprint setting the country's development priorities for the period up to 2035, both of which are being discussed at the annual "two sessions" of the country's top legislature and political advisory body, outlined key areas where reforms are expected to bring institutional changes and bolster the country's long-term growth.China pledges greater reforms to chart course for sustainable growthPhoto taken on Jan 14, 2021 shows a night view of Lujiazui in Pudong in Shanghai.
