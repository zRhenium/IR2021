China will complete the registration of real estate ownership for resettlement houses involved in the country's poverty alleviation relocation programs in an effort to expand poverty relief achievement, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources. 
To ensure that the rights and interests of relocated people are safeguarded, Zhuang Shaoqin, the vice-minister, said at a news conference on Dec 15 that local authorities are required to speed up the processing of relevant procedures and complete the registration work before the end of next June. 
Since 2015, more than 9.6 million rural residents living in inhospitable poor areas have been relocated to around 35,000 newly built residential communities as a result of the country's targeted efforts to eradicate poverty. 
No one can refuse to take renminbi cash, bank says 
The People's Bank of China said in a notice published on Dec 15 that no entity or individual can refuse to accept renminbi cash, which is the most basic means of payment in China, and those who won't accept it will be punished. 
According to the PBOC, with the wide application of digital services, some merchants and institutions in China are reluctant to accept cash due to a consumer's cost control efforts or technological inexperience, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic broke out. 
The PBOC said that it has taken a number of measures to standardize the management of cash, improve the efficiency of its circulation and ensure the rational, safe and smooth use of it by the public. 
The innovation of consumption and payment methods should be conducive to protecting people's livelihood and enhancing the public's sense of happiness, it said, noting that non-bank payment institutions must not promote the cashless concept or discriminate against cash payments. 
The central bank will investigate and punish firms or individuals that refuse to accept cash or adopt discriminatory measures against such payments, it added.Concerns over market access list and healthcare garner responseA number of central government departments, including those responsible for reform and development, healthcare, natural resources and banking have responded recently to matters of public concern.
