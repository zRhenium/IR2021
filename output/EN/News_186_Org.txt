The Belt and Road Initiative has enriched the growth of the world economy and improved people's living standard in economies participating involved in the initiative, said a member of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. 
After seven years of development, the BRI has built a solid platform for companies from various countries to carry out cooperation and made more people have a better understanding of mechanism development and infrastructure connectivity, said Zhou Yong, vice-president of China State Construction Engineering Corp. 
In addition to putting the Sukkur-Multan Motorway - a transportation infrastructure project under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, into operation in Pakistan late last year, the Chinese company, supported by more than 8,000 employees, is building projects for Egypt's new administrative capital, including 20 buildings, covering 1.9 million square meters.
