BEIJING -- China's top court on Thursday urged all courts across the country to abide by the requirements of the case filing registration system, and to remove obstacles to the filing of cases. 
In a circular issued on Thursday, the Supreme People's Court reiterated that people's courts at all levels are strictly prohibited from blocking case filings, and should file lawsuits in a timely and efficient manner whenever necessary. 
Courts should also avoid tardiness in case filing work as the year draws to an end, said the Supreme People's Court, adding that instances of tardiness had recently been observed at several regional courts. 
The Supreme People's Court noted that the case filing registration system, implemented in 2015, had significantly improved the efficiency of filing lawsuits.China's top court calls for removal of case filing obstacles[Photo/Sipa]
