TAIYUAN - China's top legislator has stressed the importance of studying and implementing Xi Jinping Thought on the Rule of Law to provide legal guarantees for the construction of a modern socialist country. 
Li Zhanshu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), made the remarks on Thursday when addressing a national symposium on local legislation held in the city of Taiyuan, Shanxi province. 
The most significant outcome of the central conference on work related to overall law-based governance was the establishment of Xi Jinping Thought on the Rule of Law, which serves as the fundamental guideline for overall law-based governance in the new era, Li said. 
He ordered the NPC and local people's congresses to develop a good grasp of Xi Jinping Thought on the Rule of Law, and to advance their legislative work while thinking in terms of the bigger picture. 
Stressing the importance of a people-centered approach to lawmaking, Li called for the improvement of legislation for the people, by the people, and in response to their new demands and expectations. 
He also said legislation should be more targeted and applicable. National and local legislation should be better coordinated, he added.Top legislator stresses importance of Xi Jinping Thought on the Rule of Law at legislation symposiumLi Zhanshu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), speaks at a national symposium on local legislation held in Taiyuan, Shanxi province, on Nov 19, 2020.
