The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country's top internet regulator, and websites of some major state news groups on Tuesday kicked off a series of online activities to mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. 
The main venue of the kick-off ceremony was set up in Beijing. Participants in six other sub-venues — Jiaxing in East China's Zhejiang province, Shenzhen in South China's Guangdong province, Wuhan in East China's Hubei province, Yan'an in Northwest China's Shaanxi province, Bijie in Southwest China's Guizhou province and Qiqihar in Northeast China's Heilongjiang province, also shared their ideas on the activities via video link on Tuesday. 
These activities, aiming to showcase the CPC's achievements in diversified aspects in the past 100 years and how the people's lives are improved, will last until the end of this year. 
The activities will include a series of reports to mark the CPC's centenary and the beginning of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25), as well as to start a new journey of comprehensively building a modern socialist country. 
Website staff members have been encouraged to go to grassroots-level areas, such as old revolutionary regions, to figure out how the CPC pursed its goals and dig out stories about how the country gained achievements in the past decades and how the Chinese people lived better lives, the statement said.Online activities kick off CPC's 100th anniversaryThe official logo for events to mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of the CPC.
