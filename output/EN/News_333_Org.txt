It is important to strengthen weak areas in the compulsory education system so that children from rural and remote areas have access to better and more equal opportunities, Li said. 
Universities and high schools must give stronger emphasis to mathematics and physics to give students a more solid theoretical foundation and foster more innovative talent, he said.
