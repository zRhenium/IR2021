Li says China still in important period of strategic opportunities for growth 
Premier Li Keqiang called on Monday for political advisers to contribute their wisdom in mapping out a blueprint for China's development over the next 15 years. 
Li delivered a report at the opening of a three-day meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the country's top political advisory body. 
The meeting is themed on studying the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which adopted the Party leadership's proposals for formulating the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) for National Economic and Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035. 
Li said that in the past five years, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with General Secretary Xi Jinping at its core, the country has responded effectively to various risks and challenges and made major achievements in economic and social development. 
Victory in the battle against poverty will be achieved as scheduled and decisive achievements will be made in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects. In particular, this year's fight against COVID-19 has yielded major strategic results, he said. 
He added that it's not easy for the country to ensure steady employment and people's livelihoods and take the lead in the world in achieving positive economic growth through timely, reasonable and effective macro-control measures. 
Li said that China is still in an important period of strategic opportunities for development and the country needs to strengthen confidence and be prepared to deal with difficulties and challenges. 
The country should give top priority to development, ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of macro policies, deepen reform and opening up, stimulate the vitality of market entities, and promote the "dual-circulation" economic mode, in which the domestic and international markets complement each other, he said. 
"We will continue to put the people first and use more resources to benefit the people," he said. 
Wang Yang, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, said political advisers should pool their wisdom and build consensus in society concerning the drawing up of the outline of the plan to help realize a good start in comprehensively building a modern socialist country.Premier urges advisers to pool wisdomPremier Li Keqiang speaks at the opening of a three-day meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing, Nov 9, 2020.
