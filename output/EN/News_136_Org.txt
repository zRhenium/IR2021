Various events and activities will be held to celebrate the centenary of the Communist Party of China, a senior Party official said on Tuesday. 
Such events and activities include conducting Party history education, holding celebration meetings, seminars and galas, organizing large-scale exhibitions and issuing artistic works and publications, Wang Xiaohui, deputy head of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee, said at a news conference in Beijing. 
A grand gathering will be held to mark the centenary of the CPC, at which President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, will deliver an important speech, he said. 
The CPC will also honor its members bearing five decades of Party membership with memorial medals, according to Wang. 
Eligible recipients will be living CPC members who have been Party members for 50 full years or longer as of July 1, 2021, and have consistently performed well in their roles. 
In addition, the CPC Central Committee will award the July 1 Medal for the first time. Outstanding Party members, exemplary Party workers, and advanced community-level Party organizations from across the country will be honored. 
Other planned events include holding major theme exhibitions, hosting theatrical performances, organizing seminars and symposiums on theoretical study, creating and promoting a series of literary and artistic works as well as publications, and carrying out Party-themed publicity and educational activities among the public, according to Wang. 
Wang said over the past 100 years, the CPC has evolved from a small party with only more than 50 members to the largest Marxist ruling party with more than 91 million members in the world. 
As of the end of 2019, the CPC had 4.68 million primary-level organizations with a total of 91.91 million members, according to the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee. 
Born in internal and external troubles and developed in hardships, the CPC has led the Chinese people on a great path in the development history of the Chinese nation and the progress history of human civilization, Wang said. 
While China is embarking on a new journey in building a modern socialist nation in an all-around way, it's of great significance to review the great journey taken by the Party and the people, sum up the glorious achievements and precious experiences over the past century, and display the historic achievements and changes in the new era under the leadership of General Secretary Xi, he said.
