BEIJING -- China's top political advisor Wang Yang has called for efforts to promote peaceful and integrated development across the Taiwan Straits and to continue to advance progress toward the peaceful reunification of China. 
Wang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, made the remarks at a conference on Taiwan affairs held in Beijing on Sunday and Monday. 
He stressed the importance of implementing the Taiwan affairs work arrangements made by the CPC Central Committee and upholding the one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus. 
Wang also underscored the importance of resolutely opposing and deterring any "Taiwan independence" separatist activities and external interference. 
While affirming the progress made in the work on Taiwan affairs in 2020, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 response, Wang warned that the cross-Straits situation would remain complicated and grave in 2021. 
Wang reiterated that "we will never allow any person or any force, in any form, to separate Taiwan from the motherland." 
He also stressed the need to support Taiwan's businesspeople and enterprises in seizing the opportunities of the motherland's new development pattern, and the need to continuously improve the institutional arrangements, policies and measures that ensure the well-being of Taiwan compatriots and achieve equal treatment.Top political advisor stresses importance of peaceful, integrated development across Taiwan StraitsChina's top political advisor Wang Yang attends a conference on Taiwan affairs held in Beijing on Jan 18, 2021.
