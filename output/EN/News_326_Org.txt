China has called for all countries to join forces and step up action on climate adaptation and work to achieve new progress on global climate governance, as 2021 marks the comprehensive implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change. 
Vice-Premier Han Zheng made the remark on Monday when addressing the Climate Adaptation Summit 2021 via video link in Beijing. The response to climate change, a common challenge facing humanity, requires accommodating both mitigation and adaptation, he said. 
Han, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said that China attaches equal importance to mitigation and adaptation, and is formulating a national strategy of adapting to climate change to make the country more resilient to climate risks. 
In order to actively implement the Paris Agreement, Han said that developed countries should offer more financial and technical support to developing countries. 
He also called on all countries to formulate and implement national adaptation plans according to their national realities. This would make their adaptation measures more effective and sustained, he said. 
The summit, which was initiated by the Netherlands, called on all governments to take more adaptation measures to reduce climate-related hazards and strengthen climate resilience. 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Tuesday that the vice-premier's participation in the event shows the high importance China attaches to international cooperation regarding climate change. 
The summit came after President Xi Jinping addressed the Climate Ambition Summit 2020 in December and Han addressed the One Planet Summit, which focused on global climate and environmental governance, earlier this month. 
China has also provided support for other developing countries to the best of its ability through South-South cooperation, Zhao said. 
With 39 cooperation agreements on climate change with 35 developing countries, China has so far allocated 1.2 billion yuan ($185 million) for South-South cooperation on tackling the global crisis, according to Huang Runqiu, minister of ecology and environment. 
"As one of the countries most adversely affected by climate change, China can empathize with the plight of other developing countries and has always proactively provided support to the best of its ability," Huang said when addressing the first ministerial dialogue held by the Global Center on Adaptation via a video link on Monday. 
"China will continue to deepen South-South cooperation to help developing countries enhance their capabilities in climate adaptation," Huang said.
