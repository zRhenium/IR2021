Premier Li Keqiang reiterated on Monday China's commitment to raising its level of opening-up across the board, fostering a new development pattern and promoting high-quality development. 
Li made the remarks as he delivered a speech via video link at a ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the signing of the convention on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
The premier said China is ready to deepen cooperation with different countries in the world, including developed nations, and promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation so that China can better share development opportunities with the world and enable mutually beneficial cooperation. 
Development remains the foundation and key element for China, as the world's largest developing country, to solve all its problems, he said. 
In the face of severe shocks from COVID-19, China has coordinated pandemic containment and socioeconomic growth and adopted a raft of measures to bring the virus under effective control, he said. 
China, having stabilized its employment market and economic fundamentals, is confident it will secure positive economic growth this year, he added. 
Li underscored the country's commitment to respect market rules and maintain the consistency, efficacy and stability of its macro policies. 
Through macro regulation and joint efforts with market players, China will strive to maintain its economic performance within a reasonable range and stabilize market expectations, he added. 
The premier noted that the global COVID response and the global economy are at a critical juncture, with the global governance system undergoing quicker transformation and fresh opportunities and challenges facing economic globalization. 
It is important to extend support to different countries to adopt necessary public health and economic measures based on their own situation, deepen international cooperation and come up with joint efforts in fighting the pandemic, stabilizing the economy and protecting public livelihoods, he said. 
Coordination on macroeconomic policies must be stepped up to safeguard the stability of global industry and supply chains, Li said, adding that the difficulties faced by developing countries should be alleviated in order to bring the global economy onto a stable recovery track as early as possible. 
Li commended the important role of the OECD in international economic cooperation, saying that the organization has long been committed to the research and coordination of international development policies. 
This year marks the 25th anniversary of China and the OECD establishing a relationship on policy dialogue and cooperation, and the two sides have conducted various forms of mutually beneficial exchanges and cooperation during this process, he noted.Li reiterates nation's dedication to opening-upPremier Li Keqiang speaks at a ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the signing of the convention on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development via video link, on Dec 14, 2020.
