BEIJING -- Chinese political advisors discussed the protection and development of marine resources at a bi-weekly seminar held recently. 
The seminar, held by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, China's top political advisory body, was presided over by Wang Yang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the CPPCC National Committee. 
Wang stressed caring, understanding, and planning for the development of the ocean while serving the country's overall strategy for building a moderately prosperous society in all respects. 
He urged efforts to follow the spirit of the 19th CPC Central Committee's fifth plenary session and strengthen China's maritime development. 
Political advisors and scholars put forward their suggestions at the seminar, while over 100 political advisors voiced their views via an online platform. 
Noting the maritime development achievements during the past five years, they also urged addressing problems in terms of resource exploitation, industry development, ecological protection, and legal systems. 
They said marine resource protection and development should be included in the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) for National Economic and Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035, noting that relevant laws and rules should be improved. 
They also stressed better ecological protection, more support for the transformation and upgrading of maritime industries, as well as more efforts in related technological innovation. 
A unified law enforcement management system should be established to improve ocean management, they added, noting that international cooperation should also be strengthened in the marine field.Political advisors discuss protection, development of marine resourcesChinese political advisors take part in a bi-weekly seminar.
