XIONG'AN -- Chinese Vice Premier Sun Chunlan on Thursday demanded the orderly relocation of Beijing-based medical facilities and institutes of higher education to the Xiong'an New Area to promote the area's high-quality construction. 
Sun made the remarks on an inspection tour to the area. Highlighting the role of quality education, medical care, and other public services in boosting the development of Xiong'an, Sun called for high-caliber management teams and professionals in the relocation drive. 
Libraries, sports venues, and other public university service facilities should also become accessible to the general public so that the arrival of the relocated universities will promote local development, Sun said. 
China announced its plan to establish the Xiong'an New Area on April 1, 2017, aiming to relieve Beijing of functions non-essential to its role as the national capital and advance the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.Chinese vice premier stresses Xiong'an New Area's quality constructionA bird's-eye view of Xiongan, North China's Hebei province, on Dec 27, 2020.
