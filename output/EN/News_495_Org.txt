Li urges SCO countries to advance integrated growthPremier Li Keqiang called upon the member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization to proactively foster new drivers of growth in areas such as the digital economy, promote high-quality development and pursue a green economic recovery. 
Li made the remark at the 19th meeting of the Council of Heads of Government of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which was held via video link on Monday. 
The SCO meeting, hosted by India, came on the heels of the organization's 20th meeting of the Council of Heads of State, which was held via video link on Nov 10. 
The premier highlighted in his remarks the need to further consolidate the foundation of integrated development of the SCO, saying that it is important to adhere to openness and cooperation and to improve the level of trade and investment liberalization and facilitation in the region. 
The SCO must work to ensure that industry and supply chains are unimpeded and to establish a network of fast lanes for essential travel within the region, he said. 
He urged better alignment between the Belt and Road Initiative and the development strategies of various member countries to promote high-quality connectivity in the region. 
The leading role of scientific and technological innovation must be amplified so as to spawn the growth of more new industries and business models, he said. 
Li also recalled joint efforts by SCO member states to make a joint response against the COVID-19 pandemic and to work together in safeguarding the regional development and stability. 
Going forward, Li said, the organization must prioritize efforts to create a safe and stable development environment and continue to conduct joint drills on counterterrorism and cooperation on eradicating extremism.

The SCO must bolster its governance capacity on data security and safeguard regional peace and stability, he said. 
China supports the national reconciliation process of Afghanistan and will help the nation achieve stability and development at an early date, he added. 
Li urged the organization to explore new room for cooperation in areas such as health, culture and sports and to expedite cooperation in the research and development of vaccines and pharmaceuticals. 
He reiterated China's pledge to make its COVID-19 vaccines a global public good once they are ready for use so as to contribute to the availability and affordability of vaccination. 
China will continue to pursue two-way opening-up and investment, develop an open world economy and ensure the smooth flow of global industry and supply chains, he said. 
The country will unwaveringly follow a path of peaceful development, adhere to an opening-up strategy featuring win-win outcomes and remain committed to sharing opportunities with the world during its own development, he added. 
Together with other leaders from SCO member states, Li signed a joint communique and approved a raft of cooperation agreements covering areas such as trade and the economy. 
All parties at the meeting also agreed to jointly fight various forms of terrorism, safeguard the peace and stability of the region and bolster people-to-people exchanges in areas regarding youth and culture, according to a news release after the meeting.Li urges SCO countries to advance integrated growthPremier Li Keqiang called upon the member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization to proactively foster new drivers of growth in areas such as the digital economy, promote high-quality development and pursue a green economic recovery.
