BEIJING -- China will roll out more than 30 policies to ensure the resources leveraged for intensive poverty elimination be redirected toward an extensive drive for rural vitalization, a government official said on Tuesday. 
China is reviewing, adjusting, optimizing and improving existing support policies for poverty alleviation, said Wang Zhengpu, head of the national administration for rural vitalization, at a press conference. 
The official pledged to keep policies consistent and stable as part of efforts to prevent people from falling back into poverty. 
China's counties have been given a five-year grace period from the day they emerged from poverty, during which they will continue to enjoy the main support policies for poverty alleviation. 
To prevent poverty relapse, China has put in place a long-term mechanism on dynamic monitoring of any trends indicating a return to poverty and regular checks on key groups, according to Wang. 
Follow-up support will be strengthened for the relocated population, with targeted efforts to develop industries, help them get jobs and improve infrastructure and public services, Wang said. 
After removing all remaining impoverished counties from the country's poverty list as of November 2020, China is now working to advance its rural vitalization strategy and prevent people from falling back into the clutches of destitution.Over 30 policies to toll out for rural vitalizatinThe sun sets on Jinxing village in Chengbu Miao ethnic autonomous county, Hunan province.
