Approval items scrapped to boost dynamismThe State Council has removed or handed down 1,094 administrative approval items since the convening of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, according to a policy briefing held by the State Council Information Office in Beijing on Tuesday.
At the briefing, officials with the State Council, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and Ministry of Commerce briefed reporters on the latest developments and plans regarding the government's efforts in streamlining administrative examination and approval to boost market dynamism.
The 1,094 items were scrapped or handed down in 16 batches over recent years, and 47 percent of such items have been taken away, so far, from the departments of the State Council, according to the briefing.
As part of the government's efforts in streamlining administration, the ongoing deepening of the administrative approval system reform aims to minimize the management of the central government in microscopic affairs and matters.
The entire process of evaluating these items involves efforts in staying problem-oriented, target-oriented and outcome-oriented, basing decisions on actual conditions, as well as ensuring holistic handling of easing approvals and boosting management, officials said.Approval items scrapped to boost dynamismThe State Council has removed or handed down 1,094 administrative approval items since the convening of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, according to a policy briefing held by the State Council Information Office in Beijing on Tuesday.
