CPC improves election work of local Party organizations via revised rulesBEIJING -- The Communist Party of China (CPC) has improved the election work of local Party organizations with newly revised election rules, according to the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee Thursday.
Elections to local Party organizations bear significant meaning to enhance the Party's political building and intraparty democracy, the department said.
The revised version of the work rules for elections to local Party organizations published by the CPC Central Committee is of great importance to standardizing the election work of CPC's local organizations and strengthening their construction, it added.
