Former tourism vice-minister expelled from CPC over bribe allegationsLi Jinzao, the former vice-minister of culture and tourism who is accused of taking bribes, has been expelled from the Communist Party of China and removed from public office for serious political disciplinary violations, the country's top anti-graft watchdogs said on Monday.
Following an investigation by the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission, Li was found to be using his post to benefit his relatives and frequently attended banquets that might affect the impartial execution of official duties.
The statement released by the watchdogs showed Li was illegally accepting property, engaging in superstitious activities, and being dishonest with the Party when he was asked about these issues during the investigation.
In addition, Li's qualification as a delegate to the 19th CPC National Congress was terminated, and his illicit gains will be confiscated, according to the statement, noting that his case will be passed to the procuratorate for further investigation and prosecution.
According to his resume from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, Li, 63, was born in Xiantao, Hubei province, and holds a doctorate in economics. He once served in senior posts in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region and in the Ministry of Commerce.Former tourism vice-minister expelled from CPC over bribe allegationsLi Jinzao, the former vice-minister of culture and tourism who is accused of taking bribes, has been expelled from the Communist Party of China and removed from public office for serious political disciplinary violations, the country's top anti-graft watchdogs said on Monday.
