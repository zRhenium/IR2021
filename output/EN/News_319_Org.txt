Different suggestions help authorities boost decision-making capabilities 
Premier Li Keqiang on Friday underlined the importance of maintaining the continuity, stability and sustainability of macroeconomic policies and called for greater reform and opening-up with a focus on improving people's livelihoods. 
Li made the remark as he presided over a symposium attended by representatives of non-Communist parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and people without party affiliation. 
The symposium solicited opinions on the draft Government Work Report and an outline for the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) for National Economic and Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035, which will be submitted to the annual session of the 13th National People's Congress in March for deliberation and approval. 
The premier stressed the need for following a new development philosophy and fostering a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulation reinforcing each other, as China enters a new development stage faced with challenges and uncertainties. 
The government must prioritize efforts to strengthen strategic support of science and technology, stimulate market vitality and social creativity, reinforce the foundation of development, unleash the potential of domestic demand and ensure and improve people's livelihoods, Li said. 
He added that inviting those outside the Communist Party of China to contribute suggestions and wisdom to the Government Work Report and the five-year plan outline is an important part of the system of CPC-led multiparty cooperation and political consultation. This helps the government improve its decision-making capabilities. 
Hao Mingjin, chairman of the Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, proposed that more efforts should be made to advance the uniformity of public services. 
Wu Weihua, chairman of the Central Committee of the Jiu San Society, suggested supporting enterprises to step up research and development efforts and pushing forward the renovation of old residential communities. 
Zhou Zhonghe, a palaeontologist and an academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, suggested greater support for key State laboratories and efforts to better guarantee people's health. 
The premier thanked them for their support for the government's work over the years. He said the State Council, the country's Cabinet, will study and absorb their suggestions and carry out government work with solid and effective measures. 
The government will work together with them to keep economic growth within a reasonable range, promote high-quality development and ensure a good start for the country's development during the 14th Five-Year Plan period, Li added.Li: Stability in economic policy neededContainers are transported at a port in Qingdao, East China's Shandong province, on Jan 12, 2021.
