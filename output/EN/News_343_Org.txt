Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, underlined on Friday the importance of exercising full and strict governance over the Party and a steadfast political direction in ensuring the implementation of goals and tasks set out in the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25). 
Xi, China's president and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remark at the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, China's top discipline watchdog. The annual session is being held from Friday to Sunday in Beijing. 
As this year marks the beginning of the five-year plan and the start of China's new journey in building a modern socialist nation, it is important to act on the principle of exercising strict governance over the Party and maintain a political orientation with an unwavering attitude, unrelenting determination and unremitting standards, he said. 
Xi underscored that improving the Party style, boosting clean governance and the fight against corruption is a journey to which there's no end. The CPC, as a major party with a centenary history, must ceaselessly move forward with work in this regard if it is to forever preserve its advanced nature, purity and vitality, he said.Xi says Party needs strict governanceSteadfast political direction required to ensure goals of 14th Five-Year Plan
