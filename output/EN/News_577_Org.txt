Express boxes recycled, sanitary toilets built to protect environmentA slew of ministry-level departments, including those responsible for logistics, health, agriculture and aviation have recently responded to matters of public concern. 
Recycling helps delivery packaging go green 
Last year, 200 million packaging boxes were recycled and reused across China's delivery and express industry, as the country made remarkable progress in the green governance of express packaging, according to a report published on Oct 23. 
Compiled by the State Post Bureau's development and research center, the report said a more environmentally friendly development framework is taking shape. 
Last year, 98 percent of delivery packages used electronic waybills to avoid the use of paper, equaling 61.7 billion sheets of A4. 
E-commerce also scaled back the use of excessive packaging, with the proportion of recycled transit bags reaching 75 percent, saving 2.48 billion single-use plastic woven bags, the report said. 
About 78 million self-assembly cartons were saved, thanks to the use of recyclable boxes, while the industry promoted low-carbon transportation by using 43,000 clean energy vehicles. 
Shen Hongyan, director of the center, said science and technology are playing more significant roles in supporting the courier industry's green development by reducing costs and promoting increased efficiency. 
The report reaffirmed the government's plan to curtail the use of nondegradable plastic packaging, plastic tape and single-use plastic woven bags at postal and express service outlets by 2025.Express boxes recycled, sanitary toilets built to protect environmentA slew of ministry-level departments, including those responsible for logistics, health, agriculture and aviation have recently responded to matters of public concern.
