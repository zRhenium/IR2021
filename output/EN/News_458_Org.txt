Action plan introduced to help develop community NPOs 
To bolster the role of nonprofit organizations in innovating governance in communities and the grassroots, a threeyear action plan aimed at accelerating the growth of NPOs was unveiled by the Ministry of Civil Affairs on Dec 7. 
A policy campaign will start next year and run until the end of 2023. 
It will promote efforts to nurture the development of volunteer organizations in rural areas to provide services that will facilitate agricultural production and daily life.

The plan called for the training of personnel nationwide and further development of a standardized system for managing NPOs, with the goal of establishing a mature working mechanism by 2023.Measures focus on rural issues and providing disaster aidA slew of ministry-level departments, including those responsible for civil affairs, emergency response, health and education have responded recently to matters of public concern.
