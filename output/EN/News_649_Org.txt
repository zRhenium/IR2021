A key Party meeting on Friday called for advancing the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing economic circle, seen as a major move to promote the new development pattern in response to the complex domestic and international situation. 
The meeting of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee reviewed a master plan for the coordinated development of Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province, and Chongqing. Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, presided over the meeting. 
Participants said that given profound changes in the development environment both at home and abroad, advancing the economic circle will help shape the regional economic structure and encourage the two cities to complement each other, according to a statement released after the meeting. It also contributes to expanding markets, optimizing and stabilizing supply chains and encouraging the new development pattern with the domestic market as the mainstay while domestic and international markets complement each other, it said. 
The meeting called for leveraging the strength of each city so as to make the economic circle an influential center, a key technological innovation hub, a shining example of reform and opening-up and a pleasant place to live. 
The cities should work together to create a high-standard market system, foster a first-class business environment and participate in construction of the Belt and Road and the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor jointly built by China and Singapore, the statement said.Economic circle to link Chongqing, ChengduChunxi Road, one of the major shopping streets in the center of Chengdu, Southwest China's Sichuan province, on March 29, 2018.
