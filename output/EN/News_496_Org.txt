The political work is the lifeline of the people's armed forces, which can only be strengthened, not weakened, according to a statement issued after the meeting.

The military should abide by the fundamental principle of absolute Party leadership over the armed forces, said the statement, adding that the practice of the Chairman of the Central Military Commission assuming full responsibility for military affairs should be entirely enforced.

The CPC Central Committee has always attached great importance to the united front and related work, the statement said.
Amending the Party's regulations on the united front work is a major task for the CPC Central Committee to exercise full, strict and rule-based governance over the Party, and an important measure to consolidate and deepen the principles of Party and state institution reform concerning the united front, it added.
