Premier Li Keqiang reiterated on Tuesday China's commitment to expand opening-up with stronger resolve, saying that the government will keep improving institutional mechanisms to attract more foreign talent and offer more convenience for expats in China. 
Speaking in Beijing at a symposium with representatives of expats working in China, Li said China will continue to absorb all leading scientific concepts and research methods that are worthwhile to be learned and welcomes more foreign experts to come to China for job opportunities. 
The premier heard opinions and suggestions on issues including the Chinese economy, the financial sector, research on fundamental science, prevention and control of COVID-19 and education from expats from countries including the United States, Italy, Singapore, Nepal and the United Kingdom. 
China will continue to coordinate epidemic containment and socioeconomic development and maintain the consistency, stability and sustainability of macro policies in the face of a complex and arduous domestic and external environment and various challenges, he said. 
He noted that China attained positive economic growth in 2020 with joint efforts from all over the nation, as well as positive contribution from foreign experts. 
Facing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government came up with tailored and effective macro policies focusing on the development of market players and people's livelihoods, he said. 
The policies were timely, decisive and averted a deluge of strong stimulus policies, which enabled a relatively quick economic recovery and growth, he said. 
He said that market forces and the vitality of market players underpinned the country's economic growth last year, which stood at 2.3 percent year-on-year. 
Going forward, China will keep its major economic indicators within a reasonable range, further consolidate its economic fundamentals and maintain the momentum of long-term and sustained economic growth, he said. 
China, as the world's largest developing country, has a huge market potential and a long way to go in its modernization, he said. 
He highlighted the importance of relying on reform and opening-up as the impetus, better handling the relationship between the market and government, and fostering a new development paradigm. 
The premier extended holiday greetings for the Spring Festival, which falls on Feb 12, to expats in China, saying that the Chinese people appreciate their contribution to the nation's modernization process.Li: China open to foreign expertsPremier noted nation attained economic growth in 2020 with expats' contribution
