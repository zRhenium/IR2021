The decision was adopted by the NPC Standing Committee on Saturday.
Apart from routine tasks that are proposed to be reviewed during the 13th NPC's fourth session, including work reports of the government, top judicial authorities and the annual budget, the decision also recommends the session deliberate the draft of 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) for National Economic and Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035.
Additionally, draft amendments to the NPC's organic law and the NPC's procedural rules are also expected to be reviewed during the fourth session, the decision added.
It was also recommended that the fourth session of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the country's top political advisory body, begin on March 4 in Beijing. The suggestion was raised in a draft decision approved at a Chairperson's Council meeting of the 13th CPPCC National Committee last week.
