Deepening reform, opening up needed for 2021-25 blueprint: PremierPremier Li Keqiang stressed the importance of showcasing China's resolve to further reform and opening up, as the country devises its blueprint for social and economic development for the 2021-25 period.
Speaking on Wednesday in Beijing at a State Council meeting on China's 14th Five-Year Plan, Li said the country must give full play to the decisive role of the market in the allocation of resources and enable the government to play a better role going forward.
He highlighted the role of deepening reform in creating jobs, promoting innovation, creating wealth and enabling sustainable development, saying that reform is the key to further unleash market vitality and social creativity.
Innovation at the institutional and systemic level must be moved forward to amplify the role of government funding in spurring private investment during the implementation of key projects concerning public livelihoods and expanding effective investment, he said.
The country must come up with new opening-up measures at the institutional level to better the environment for foreign trade and investment, and enhance international exchanges and cooperation, the premier said.
With China's already large economic volume, Li said it would be a remarkable achievement to attain a reasonable growth rate in the next five years.
In proposing tasks and measures to promote industrial development, reinforce the infrastructure and implement projects of public livelihood, the blueprint must prioritize key areas and ensure its preset targets can be met, he said.
It is important to plan growth for the next five years and ensure its alignment with long-term targets through 2035 while making due arrangements for economic recovery in the next two years to consolidate the foundation for growth, he said.
The Communist Party of China Central Committee has already adopted a proposal for the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) for National Economic and Social Development and Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035 at its Fifth Plenary Session in October.
The State Council will devise the blueprint based on the proposal before submitting it to next year's session of National People's Congress for approval.Deepening reform, opening up needed for 2021-25 blueprint: PremierPremier Li Keqiang stressed the importance of showcasing China's resolve to further reform and opening up, as the country devises its blueprint for social and economic development for the 2021-25 period.
